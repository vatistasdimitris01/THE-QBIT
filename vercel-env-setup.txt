# Vercel Environment Variable Setup Guide for THE QBIT

To deploy your news aggregator application on Vercel, you need to configure the following environment variable in your Vercel project settings. This keeps your API key secure and separate from your code.

## Required Environment Variable

You need to add one secret key to your Vercel project.

1.  **`API_KEY`**
    *   **Purpose**: This is your API key for the Google Gemini API, which generates the news briefings.
    *   **How to get it**: Visit Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create and copy your API key.

## How to Add the Variable to Vercel

1.  Go to your project's dashboard on Vercel.
2.  Click on the "Settings" tab.
3.  In the left sidebar, click on "Environment Variables".
4.  Add a new variable:
    *   Enter the name `API_KEY`.
    *   Paste the corresponding value.
    *   Ensure the type is "Secret".
    *   Click "Add".
5.  After adding the variable, you may need to redeploy your project for the changes to take effect.

**IMPORTANT:** Never expose this key in your frontend code or commit it to your Git repository. Using Vercel's environment variables is the correct and secure way to handle it.
