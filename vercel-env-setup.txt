# Vercel Environment Variable Setup Guide for THE QBIT

To deploy your news aggregator application on Vercel, you need to configure the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings. This keeps your API keys secure and separate from your code.

## Required Environment Variables

You need to add three secret keys to your Vercel project.

1.  **`API_KEY`**
    *   **Purpose**: This is your API key for the Google Gemini API, which generates the news briefings.
    *   **How to get it**: Visit Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create and copy your API key.

2.  **`CSE_API_KEY`**
    *   **Purpose**: This is the API key for the Google Custom Search JSON API, which the AI uses to find recent news articles.
    *   **How to get it**:
        1.  Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
        2.  Create a new project or select an existing one.
        3.  Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
        4.  Click "Create Credentials" > "API key".
        5.  **Important**: Make sure the "Custom Search API" is enabled for your project in the "Library" section.

3.  **`CSE_ID`**
    *   **Purpose**: This is the unique ID for your Programmable Search Engine instance. It tells Google which sites to search.
    *   **How to get it**:
        1.  Go to the Programmable Search Engine control panel (https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/).
        2.  Create a new search engine.
        3.  Configure it to search the entire web or specific news sites.
        4.  On the "Basics" tab of the control panel, find and copy your "Search engine ID".

## Vercel KV Store (Required for Sharing Feature)

The shareable link feature **requires** a Vercel KV store to be connected to your project.

1.  Go to your project's dashboard on Vercel.
2.  Click on the **Storage** tab.
3.  Click **Create Database** and select **KV (Redis)**.
4.  Follow the prompts to create the store and connect it to your current project.
5.  Vercel will automatically add the necessary environment variables (like `KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, etc.) to your project settings. **You do not need to add these manually.**

## How to Add API Variables to Vercel

1.  Go to your project's dashboard on Vercel.
2.  Click on the "Settings" tab.
3.  In the left sidebar, click on "Environment Variables".
4.  For each key (`API_KEY`, `CSE_API_KEY`, `CSE_ID`), add a new variable:
    *   Enter the name (e.g., `API_KEY`).
    *   Paste the corresponding value.
    *   Ensure the type is "Secret".
    *   Click "Add".
5.  Repeat for all three variables.
6.  After adding the variables and connecting the KV store, you must redeploy your project for the changes to take effect.

**IMPORTANT:** Never expose these keys in your frontend code or commit them to your Git repository. Using Vercel's environment variables is the correct and secure way to handle them.
